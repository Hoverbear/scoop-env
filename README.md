This repo includes a `Vagrantfile` that will boot up a Fedora 20 based host box. The disk has been extended and it will automatically pull down various repos related to the SCOOP project.

You'll need:

* Vagrant
* Virtualbox
* ~50GB disk space

Currently, there is no publicly available data for the `data/` folder, we're working on this. For now, please place a hub dump into the `data/hub-dump` folder.
